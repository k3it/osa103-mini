# osa103-mini
Software Defined Multifunctional Measurment Device - VNA, Oscilloscope, Antenna Analyzer, Signal Generator, SDR trasceiver etc

- Some years ago, I entered the OSA103 schematic, published by the device's author, into KiCad, and routed and created the PCB. I was able to assemble the device and was in the process of debugging it. It was a personal project undertaken out of pure curiosity and to learn KiCad. Unfortunately, my vision started to deteriorate to the point where troubleshooting a small SMD board was no longer enjoyable, and I ultimately abandoned the project. I am releasing all of the files from the project directory, including the gerbers, in case someone finds them useful.

- All credit for the original device goes to the person named Sergey from Perm, Russia. You may be able to reach him via a forum on a site called cqham or https://www.osa103.ru (which seems to be down as of spring 2023).   I have no contacts with the forum since the start of the war in Feb 2022.  

- Please note that you may need to pay for a software license to use the official software for this board. I haven't kept up with the development, so use this project at your own risk. That being said, this is an ingenious and clever device, so have fun!

- I have no affiliation or contact with the author or the websites mentioned above, and I have no idea about the author's position regarding the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. However, I hope that the author stands against it, which seems to be the case with the majority of intelligent people. When you communicate with Sergey may be  you will be able clarify his stance.  Thank you
